      <description>This is my first Os build.It took us only 1 week to make even when all of the code was available online.I was faced with 3 different errors which took a long time to debug.Learned how to use git,github,Hugo,Docker and qemu.
Os: This is a 64-bit operating system which is is made in C and assembly.
Main Components:   DockerFile This is a file which creates a sort of environment to build our Os.</description>
